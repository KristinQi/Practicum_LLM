Answer: Noonan syndrome is linked to defects in several genes. Certain proteins involved in growth and development become overactive as a result of these gene changes.  Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. This means only one parent has to pass down the nonworking gene for the child to have the syndrome. However, some cases may not be inherited.)",3-Incomplete, ADAM_0002818_Sec2.txt,What causes Noonan syndrome ?,"Noonan syndrome is linked to defects in several genes.

Answer: Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal development of multiple parts of the body. Features of Noonan syndrome may include a distinctive facial appearance, short stature, a broad or webbed neck, congenital heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and developmental delay. Noonan syndrome may be caused by mutations in any one of several genes including the PTPN11, KRAS, RAF1, SOS1, NRAS and BRAF genes. It is sometimes referred to as a specific subtype based on the responsible gene in an affected person. Noonan syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but many cases are due to a new mutation and are not inherited from an affected parent.)",3-Incomplete, GARD_0004450_Sec1.txt,What is (are) Noonan syndrome ?

Answer: How is Noonan syndrome inherited? Noonan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause the condition. Each child of a person with Noonan syndrome has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the condition. In some cases, the condition is inherited from an affected parent. Because the features of the condition can vary and may be very subtle, many affected adults are diagnosed only after the birth of a more obviously affected infant.

GHR_0000804_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease
Answer: Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.  Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture.  The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.)",3-Incomplete, GHR_0000804_Sec1.txt,What is (are) polycystic kidney disease ?

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease
Answer: Mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes cause polycystic kidney disease.  Mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PKD1 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 1, and PKD2 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. Researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. People with mutations in the PKD2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with PKD1 mutations. The signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a PKD2 mutation.  Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. Researchers have not determined how mutations in the PKHD1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease.  Although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. These cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease. This form of the disorder occurs most often in people with other types of kidney disease who have been treated for several years with hemodialysis (a procedure that filters waste products from the blood).)",3-Incomplete, GHR_0000804_Sec3.txt,What are the genetic changes related to polycystic kidney disease ?

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease
Answer: Most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. People with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene in each cell. In about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified.  Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.)",3-Incomplete, GHR_0000804_Sec4.txt,Is polycystic kidney disease inherited ?

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601129.html
Answer: Zolmitriptan comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take zolmitriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take zolmitriptan, do not take a second tablet without calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets or orally disintegrating tablets you may take in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zolmitriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  You may take your first dose of zolmitriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.  If your doctor has prescribed a dose lower than 2.5 mg, you may use your fingers to break the 2.5-mg tablet on the line that divides it in half. However, you should not break or split the orally disintegrating tablet.  To take the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets. Do not open the foil packaging or remove the orally disintegrating tablet until just before you are ready to take it.  Call your doctor if your headaches do not get better or occur more frequently after taking zolmitriptan.  If you take zolmitriptan more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your headaches may get worse or may occur more frequently. You should not take zolmitriptan or any other headache medication for more than 10 days per month.

ADAM_0003820_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Syphilis - primary ? (Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000861.htm
Answer: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted, infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.  Syphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 to 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.  Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).  Syphilis has three stages:  - Primary syphilis  - Secondary syphilis  - Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness)    Secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States as they were in the past because of the availability of:  - Free, government-sponsored sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics  - Screening tests for syphilis  - Public education about STIs  - Prenatal screening)",3-Incomplete, ADAM_0003820_Sec2.txt,What causes Syphilis - primary ?

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/syphilis.html
Answer: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. It infects the genital area, lips, mouth, or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.    The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.    Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading syphilis.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000861.htm
Answer: Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as:   - Doxycycline  - Penicillin G benzathine  - Tetracycline (for patients who are allergic to penicillin)    Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the patient's overall health.  To treat syphilis during pregnancy, penicillin is the drug of choice. Tetracycline cannot be used for treatment because it is dangerous to the unborn baby. Erythromycin may not prevent congenital syphilis in the baby. People who are allergic to penicillin should ideally be desensitized to it, and then treated with penicillin.  Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.  Symptoms and signs of this reaction include:  - Chills  - Fever  - General ill feeling (malaise)  - Headache  - Joint aches  - Muscle aches  - Nausea  - Rash    These symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours.  Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.  All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated.

Answer: Glucagon is usually given by injection beneath the skin, in the muscle, or in the vein. It comes as a powder and liquid that will need to be mixed just before administering the dose. Instructions for mixing and giving the injection are in the package. Glucagon should be administered as soon as possible after discovering that the patient is unconscious from low blood sugar. After the injection, the patient should be turned onto the side to prevent choking if they vomit. Once the glucagon has been given, contact your doctor.

ADAM_0000455_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Birth control pill overdose
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002599.htm
Answer: Summary : Birth control pills, also called oral contraceptives, are prescription medicines used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control pill overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Most birth control pills contain one of the following combinations of estrogen and progestin hormones:  - Ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl estradiol  - Ethynodiol diacetate and mestranol  - Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol  - Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol  - Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol  - Mestranol and norethindrone  - Mestranol and norethynodrel  - Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol   These birth control pills contain progestin only:  - Norethindrone  - Norgestrel   Other birth control pills may also contain these ingredients.

Where Found : Here are several birth control medicines, with their brand names in parentheses:  - Ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate (Demulen)  - Mestranol and ethynodiol diacetate (Ovulen)  - Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Nordette, Tri-Levlen, Triphasil)  - Norethindrone (Micronor, Nor-Q.D.)  - Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (Loestrin, Norlestrin)  - Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Brevicon, Ortho-Novum 1/35, Modicon, Ortho-Novum 7/7/7, Ovcon)  - Mestranol and norethindrone (Ortho-Novum 1/50)  - Mestranol and norethynodrel (Enovid)  - Norgestrel (Ovrette)  - Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Lo Ovral, Ovral)   Other birth control pills may also be available.

Symptoms : Symptoms of an overdose of birth control pills include:  - Breast tenderness  - Discolored urine  - Drowsiness  - Heavy vaginal bleeding (2 to 7 days after the overdose)  - Headache  - Emotional changes  - Nausea and vomiting  - Rash

Home Care : Seek medical help right away, and call poison control. Do NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.  Stop using the birth control pills and use other methods to prevent pregnancy, if desired. The overdose is NOT likely to be life-threatening.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - The name of the medicine (ingredients and strength, if known)  - When it was swallowed  - The amount swallowed  - If the medicine was prescribed for the person

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : A trip to the emergency room (ER) will probably not be necessary. If you do go, take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.  If an ER visit is needed, the provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:  - Activated charcoal (in extreme cases)  - Blood and urine tests  - Medicines to treat symptoms

Outlook (Prognosis) : Serious symptoms are very unlikely.)",3-Incomplete, ADAM_0000455_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Birth control pill overdose,"Summary : Birth control pills, also called oral contraceptives, are prescription medicines used to prevent pregnancy.

URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dvt
Answer: Blood clots can form in your body's deep veins if:
                
A vein's inner lining is damaged. Injuries caused by physical, chemical, or biological factors can damage the veins. Such factors include surgery, serious injuries, inflammation, and immune responses.
                
Blood flow is sluggish or slow. Lack of motion can cause sluggish or slow blood flow. This may occur after surgery, if you're ill and in bed for a long time, or if you're traveling for a long time.
                
Your blood is thicker or more likely to clot than normal. Some inherited conditions (such as factor V Leiden) increase the risk of blood clotting. Hormone therapy or birth control pills also can increase the risk of clotting.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000503.htm
Answer: Post-streptococcal GN is a form of glomerulonephritis. It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat.  The strep bacterial infection causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the urine.  Post-streptococcal GN is uncommon today because infections that can lead to the disorder are commonly treated with antibiotics. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection.  It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis
Answer: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a condition that causes inflammation that primarily affects the respiratory tract (including the lungs and airways) and the kidneys. This disorder is also commonly known as Wegener granulomatosis. A characteristic feature of GPA is inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), particularly the small- and medium-sized blood vessels in the lungs, nose, sinuses, windpipe, and kidneys, although vessels in any organ can be involved. Polyangiitis refers to the inflammation of multiple types of vessels, such as small arteries and veins. Vasculitis causes scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.  Another characteristic feature of GPA is the formation of granulomas, which are small areas of inflammation composed of immune cells that aid in the inflammatory reaction. The granulomas usually occur in the lungs or airways of people with this condition, although they can occur in the eyes or other organs. As granulomas grow, they can invade surrounding areas, causing tissue damage.  The signs and symptoms of GPA vary based on the tissues and organs affected by vasculitis. Many people with this condition experience a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), fever, weight loss, or other general symptoms of the body's immune reaction. In most people with GPA, inflammation begins in the vessels of the respiratory tract, leading to nasal congestion, frequent nosebleeds, shortness of breath, or coughing. Severe inflammation in the nose can lead to a hole in the tissue that separates the two nostrils (nasal septum perforation) or a collapse of the septum, causing a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose).  The kidneys are commonly affected in people with GPA. Tissue damage caused by vasculitis in the kidneys can lead to decreased kidney function, which may cause increased blood pressure or blood in the urine, and life-threatening kidney failure. Inflammation can also occur in other regions of the body, including the eyes, middle and inner ear structures, skin, joints, nerves, heart, and brain. Depending on which systems are involved, additional symptoms can include skin rashes, inner ear pain, swollen and painful joints, and numbness or tingling in the limbs.  GPA is most common in middle-aged adults, although it can occur at any age. If untreated, the condition is usually fatal within 2 years of diagnosis.

Answer: Strep is short for Streptococcus, a type of bacteria. There are two types: group A and group B.    Group A strep causes       - Strep throat - a sore, red throat, sometimes with white spots on the tonsils    - Scarlet fever - an illness that follows strep throat. It causes a red rash on the body.    - Impetigo - a skin infection    - Toxic shock syndrome    - Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease)       Group B strep can cause blood infections, pneumonia and meningitis in newborns. A screening test during pregnancy can tell if you have it. If you do, I.V. antibiotics during labor can save your baby's life. Adults can also get group B strep infections, especially if they are elderly or already have health problems. Strep B can cause urinary tract infections, blood infections, skin infections and pneumonia in adults.    Antibiotics are used to treat strep infections.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001000.htm
Answer: The retina is at the back of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A part of the retina called the macula makes vision sharper and more detailed.It is a yellow spot in the center of the retina. It is made up of 2 natural colors (pigments) called lutein and zeaxanthin.  AMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula.  There are two types of AMD:  -  Dry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form.  -  Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid. Thistype of AMDcauses most of the vision loss associated with the condition.   Doctorsare not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs most inpersons 75 years or older.

GHR_0000027_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to age-related macular degeneration ? (Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration
Answer: Age-related macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many of these factors have been identified, but some remain unknown.  Researchers have considered changes in many genes as possible risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these genes are involved in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. This system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Genetic changes in and around several complement system genes, including the CFH gene, contribute to a person's risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. It is unclear how these genetic changes are related to the retinal damage and vision loss characteristic of this condition.  Changes on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26 are also associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. The 10q26 region contains two genes of interest, ARMS2 and HTRA1. Changes in both genes have been studied as possible risk factors for the disease. However, because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell which gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration risk, or whether increased risk results from variations in both genes.  Other genes that are associated with age-related macular degeneration include genes involved in transporting and processing high-density lipoprotein (HDL, also known as ""good"" cholesterol) and genes that have been associated with other forms of macular disease.  Researchers have also examined nongenetic factors that contribute to the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Age appears to be the most important risk factor; the chance of developing the condition increases significantly as a person gets older. Smoking is another established risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. Other factors that may increase the risk of this condition include high blood pressure, heart disease, a high-fat diet or one that is low in certain nutrients (such as antioxidants and zinc), obesity, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605042.html
Answer: Estradiol increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]). The longer you use estradiol, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you should be given another medication called a progestin to take with transdermal estradiol. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer. Before you begin using transdermal estradiol, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer and if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. Call your doctor immediately if you have abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding during your treatment with transdermal estradiol. Your doctor will watch you closely to help ensure you do not develop endometrial cancer during or after your treatment.  In a large study, women who took estrogens (a group of medications that includes estradiol) by mouth with progestins had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand). Women who use transdermal estradiol alone or with progestins may also have a higher risk of developing these conditions. Tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke in the past year, and if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus ( a condition in which the body attacks its own tissues causing damage and swelling), breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer).  The following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are using transdermal estradiol: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; double vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things; breast lumps or other breast changes; discharge from nipples; or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg.  You can take steps to decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while you are using transdermal estradiol. Do not use transdermal estradiol alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Use the lowest dose of transdermal estradiol that controls your symptoms and only use transdermal estradiol as long as needed. Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should use a lower dose of transdermal estradiol or should stop using the medication.  You should examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and a breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible. Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history.  Tell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bedrest.

ADAM_0001324_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Ear wax (Also called: Ear impaction; Cerumen impaction; Ear blockage)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000979.htm
Answer: Summary : The ear canal is lined with hair follicles and glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.   Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.

Causes : Ear wax protects the ear by:  - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and smallobjects from entering and damaging the ear   - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal   In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeperand blockthe ear canal.

Symptoms : - Earache  - Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged  - Noises in the ear (tinnitus)  - Partial hearing loss, may get worse

Treatment : Most cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home. The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear:  -  Baby oil   -  Commercial drops   -  Glycerin   -  Mineral oil   -  Water    Another method is to wash out the wax.   - Use body-temperature water (cooler or warmer water may cause brief but severe dizziness or vertigo).  - Hold your head upright andstraighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward.  - Use a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug.  - Tip your head to allow the water to drain. You may need to repeat irrigation several times.    To avoid damaging your ear or causing an infection:  - Never irrigate the ear if the eardrum may have a hole in it.  - Do not irrigate the ear with a jet irrigator designed for cleaning teeth (such as a WaterPik).    After the wax is removed, dry the ear thoroughly. You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear.  You may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying.  - Do not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears.  - Never try to clean the ear by putting any object, such as a cotton swab, into the ear canal.    If you cannot remove the wax plug or you have discomfort, consult a health care provider, who may remove the wax by:  - Repeating the irrigation attempts  -  Suctioning the ear canal   -  Using a small device called a curette   -  Using a microscope to help

Outlook (Prognosis) : The ear may become blocked with wax again in the future. Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed.  Rarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal or damage to the eardrum.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if your ears are blocked with wax and you are unable to remove the wax.  Also call if you have an ear wax blockage and you develop new symptoms, such as:  - Drainage from the ear  - Ear pain  - Fever  - Hearing loss that continues afteryou cleanthe wax)", 4-Excellent, ADAM_0001324_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Ear wax (Also called: Ear impaction; Cerumen impaction; Ear blockage),Summary : The ear canal is lined with hair follicles and glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome
Answer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.  The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals.

In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome
Answer: The genetic causes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are complex. The condition usually results from the abnormal regulation of genes in a particular region of chromosome 11. People normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. For most genes on chromosome 11, both copies of the gene are expressed, or ""turned on,"" in cells. For some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternally inherited copy) is expressed. For other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) is expressed. These parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting are responsible for most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  At least half of all cases result from changes in a process called methylation. Methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene's parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is often associated with changes in regions of DNA on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers (ICs). ICs control the methylation of several genes that are involved in normal growth, including the CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1 genes. Abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to overgrowth and the other characteristic features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About twenty percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Paternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of paternally inherited genes rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother. People with paternal UPD are also missing genes that are active only on the maternally inherited copy of the chromosome. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, paternal UPD usually occurs early in embryonic development and affects only some of the body's cells. This phenomenon is called mosaicism. Mosaic paternal UPD leads to an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 11, which underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder.  Less commonly, mutations in the CDKN1C gene cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control growth before birth. Mutations in the CDKN1C gene prevent this protein from restraining growth, which leads to the abnormalities characteristic of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About 1 percent of all people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a chromosomal abnormality such as a rearrangement (translocation), abnormal copying (duplication), or loss (deletion) of genetic material from chromosome 11. Like the other genetic changes responsible for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, these abnormalities disrupt the normal regulation of certain genes on this chromosome.)", 4-Excellent, GHR_0000113_Sec3.txt,What are the genetic changes related to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ?

Answer: In about 85 percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, only one person in a family has been diagnosed with the condition. However, parents of one child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may be at risk of having other children with the disorder. This risk depends on the genetic cause of the condition.

Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherit the genetic change from their mothers. Occasionally, a person who inherits the altered gene will not have any of the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007663.htm
Answer: Summary : Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is surgery to open the upper airways by taking out extra tissue in the throat. It may be done to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or severe snoring.

Description : Surgery known as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) removes soft tissue at the back of the throat. This includes:  - All or part of the uvula (the soft flap of tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth).  - Parts of the soft palate and tissue at the sides of the throat.  - Tonsils and adenoids, if they are still there.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Your doctor may recommend this surgery if you have mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  - Try lifestyle changes, such as weight loss or changing your sleep position.  - Most experts recommend trying to use CPAP or an oral device to treat OSA first.    Your doctor may recommend this surgery to treat severe snoring, even if you do not have OSA. Before you decide about this surgery:  - See if weight loss helps your snoring.  - Consider how important it is to you to treat snoring. The surgery does not work for everyone.  - Make sure your insurance will pay for this surgery. If you do not also have OSA, your insurance may not cover the surgery.    Sometimes, UPPP is done along with other more invasive surgeries to treat more severe OSA.

Risks : Risks for any surgery are:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Heart problems  - Bleeding  - Infection    Risks for this surgery are:  - Damage to the muscles in the throat and soft palate. You may have some problems keeping liquids from coming up through your nose when drinking (called velopharyngeal insufficiency). Most often, this is only a temporary side effect.  - Mucus in the throat  - Speech changes

Before the Procedure : Be sure to tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What drugs you are taking, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription  - If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day   During the days before the surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot.  - Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.   On the day of the surgery:  - You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery.  - Take any drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.

After the Procedure : This surgery most often requires an overnight stay in the hospital to make sure you can swallow. UPPP surgery can be painful and full recovery takes 2 or 3 weeks.  - Your throat will be very sore for up to several weeks. You will get liquid pain medicines to ease the soreness.  - You may have stitches in the back of your throat. These will dissolve or your doctor will remove them at the first follow-up visit.  - Eat only soft foods and liquids for the first 2 weeks after surgery. Avoid crunchy foods or foods that are hard to chew.  - You will need to rinse your mouth after meals with a salt-water solution for the first 7 to 10 days.  - Avoid heavy lifting or straining for the first 2 weeks. You may walk and do light activity after 24 hours.  - You will have a follow-up visit with your doctor 2 or 3 weeks after the surgery.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Sleep apnea improves at first for about half of the people who have this surgery. Over time, the benefit wears off for many people.  Some studies suggest that surgery is best suited only for people with abnormalities in the soft palate.)", 4-Excellent, ADAM_0004167_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) (Also called: Palate surgery; Uvulopalatal flap procedure; UPPP; Laser-assisted uvulopalaplasty; Radiofrequency palatoplasty; Velopharyngeal insufficiency - UPPP; Obstructive sleep apnea - uvulopalaplasty; OSA - uvulopalaplasty),Summary : Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is surgery to open the upper airways by taking out extra tissue in the throat.

Answer: Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. It can also be caused byinfection or exposure to toxins. In many cases, the cause is unknown.  The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis. This involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it usually only affects the iris, the colored part of the eye. The inflammation may be linked with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.  Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the uvea. It involves primarily the choroid, which is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle part of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. You may develop this condition if you have had a body-wide (systemic) infection or if you have an autoimmune disease.  Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. This inflammation affects the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid.

Answer: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes.  About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear.  Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations.  More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression).

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.

GHR_0000063_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/antiphospholipid-syndrome
Answer: Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body, but most frequently occur in the vessels of the lower limbs. If a blood clot forms in the vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.  Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy. These complications include pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency), early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). In addition, women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at greater risk of having a thrombosis during pregnancy than at other times during their lives. At birth, infants of mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight.  A thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of antiphospholipid syndrome. This condition usually appears in early to mid-adulthood but can begin at any age.  Other signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include a reduced amount of blood clotting cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis), and a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. In addition, affected individuals may have open sores (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, heart disease, or intellectual disability. Many people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.  Rarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body. These thromboses block blood flow in affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ failure. These individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals.

GHR_0000063_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/antiphospholipid-syndrome
Answer: The genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. This condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins (antibodies) in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome attack normal human proteins. When these antibodies attach (bind) to proteins, the proteins change shape and bind to other molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. Binding to cells, particularly immune cells, turns on (activates) the blood clotting pathway and other immune responses.  The production of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I may coincide with exposure to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, that are similar to normal human proteins. Exposure to these foreign invaders may cause the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection, but because the invaders are so similar to the body's own proteins, the antibodies also attack the human proteins. Similar triggers may occur during pregnancy when a woman's physiology, particularly her immune system, adapts to accommodate the developing fetus. These changes during pregnancy may explain the high rate of affected females.  Certain genetic variations (polymorphisms) in a few genes have been found in people with antiphospholipid syndrome and may predispose individuals to produce the specific antibodies known to contribute to the formation of thromboses. However, the contribution of these genetic changes to the development of the condition is unclear.  People who test positive for all three antibodies but have not had a thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages are said to be antiphospholipid carriers.

NHLBI_0000005_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aps
Answer: Antiphospholipid (AN-te-fos-fo-LIP-id) antibody syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur if the body's immune system makes antibodies that attack and damage tissues or cells.
                
Antibodies are a type of protein. They usually help defend the body against infections. In APS, however, the body makes antibodies that mistakenly attack phospholipidsa type of fat.
                
Phospholipids are found in all living cells and cell membranes, including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels.
                
When antibodies attack phospholipids, cells are damaged. This damage causes blood clots to form in the body's arteries and veins. (These are the vessels that carry blood to your heart and body.)
                
Usually, blood clotting is a normal bodily process. Blood clots help seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls. This prevents you from losing too much blood. In APS, however, too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the body's organs.
                
Overview
                
Some people have APS antibodies, but don't ever have signs or symptoms of the disorder. Having APS antibodies doesn't mean that you have APS. To be diagnosed with APS, you must have APS antibodies and a history of health problems related to the disorder.
                
APS can lead to many health problems, such as stroke, heart attack, kidney damage, deep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), and pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm).
                
APS also can cause pregnancy-related problems, such as multiple miscarriages, a miscarriage late in pregnancy, or a premature birth due to eclampsia (ek-LAMP-se-ah). (Eclampsia, which follows preeclampsia, is a serious condition that causes seizures in pregnant women.)
                
Very rarely, some people who have APS develop many blood clots within weeks or months. This condition is called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS).
                
People who have APS also are at higher risk for thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah). This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets). Antibodies destroy the platelets, or theyre used up during the clotting process. Mild to serious bleeding can occur with thrombocytopenia.
                
APS can be fatal. Death may occur as a result of large blood clots or blood clots in the heart, lungs, or brain.
                
Outlook
                
APS can affect people of any age. However, it's more common in women and people who have other autoimmune or rheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) disorders, such as lupus. (""Rheumatic"" refers to disorders that affect the joints, bones, or muscles.)
                
APS has no cure, but medicines can help prevent its complications. Medicines are used to stop blood clots from forming. They also are used to keep existing clots from getting larger. Treatment for APS is long term.
                
If you have APS and another autoimmune disorder, it's important to control that condition as well. When the other condition is controlled, APS may cause fewer problems.)

This prevents you from losing too much blood. In APS, however, too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the body's organs.
                
Researchers don't know why APS antibodies cause blood clots to form. Some believe that the antibodies damage or affect the inner lining of the blood vessels, which causes blood clots to form. Others believe that the immune system makes antibodies in response to blood clots damaging the blood vessels.)

NINDS_0000024_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/antiphosphlipid/antiphospholipid.htm
Answer: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused when antibodies -- immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses -- mistakenly attack healthy body tissues and organs. In APS, specific antibodies activate the inner lining of blood vessels, which leads to the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins. APS is sometimes called sticky blood syndrome, because of the increased tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries. The symptoms of APS are due to the abnormal blood clotting. Clots can develop in the veins of the legs and lungs, or in the placenta of pregnant women. One of the most serious complications of APS occurs when a clot forms in the brain and causes a stroke. Other neurological symptoms include chronic headaches, dementia (similar to the dementia of Alzheimers disease), and seizures. Infrequently, individuals will develop chorea (a movement disorder in which the body and limbs writhe uncontrollably), cognitive dysfunction (such as poor memory), transverse myelitis, depression or psychosis, optic neuropathy, or sudden hearing loss. In pregnant women, clots in the placenta can cause miscarriages. APS is diagnosed by the presence of a positive antiphospholipid antibody and either a history of blood clots in an artery or vein or a history of multiple miscarriages or other pregnancy problems. Some individuals will have a characteristic lacy, net-like red rash called livedo reticularis over their wrists and knees.)

Answer: Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is often used to replace this chemical when your body does not make enough of it. It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma. Methylprednisolone is also used to treat certain types of cancer.

Answer: Methylprednisolone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methylprednisolone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Do not stop taking methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor. Stopping the drug abruptly can cause loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss. If you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely.

(Also called: bundle branch block; HBBD; hereditary bundle branch defect; hereditary bundle branch system defect; Lenegre Lev disease; Lev-Lengre disease; Lev syndrome; Lev's disease; PCCD; progressive cardiac conduction defect)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-familial-heart-block
Answer: Progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. A normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. These signals begin in a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). From there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of His. This bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). Electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria.  Heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. In people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. Partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical impulses. Fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. Complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, fainting (syncope), or sudden cardiac arrest and death.  Progressive familial heart block can be divided into type I and type II, with type I being further divided into types IA and IB. These types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. In types IA and IB, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type II, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. The different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms.  Most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. The most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs as a normal process of aging. Other causes of heart block can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue.)

ADAM_0000682_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cardiac ablation procedures (Also called: Catheter ablation; Radiofrequency catheter ablation; Cryoablation)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007368.htm
Answer: Summary : Cardiac ablation is a procedure that is used to scar small areas in your heart that may be involved in your heart rhythm problems. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through the heart.   During the procedure, small wires called electrodes are placed inside your heart to measure your heart's electrical activity. When the source of the problem is found, the tissue causing the problem is destroyed.

Description : There are two methods for performing cardiac ablation:   - Radiofrequency ablation uses heat energy to eliminate the problem area.  - Cryoablation uses very cold temperatures.    The type of procedure you have will depend on what kind of abnormal heart rhythm you have.   Cardiac ablation procedures are done in a hospital laboratory by trained staff. This includes cardiologists (heart doctors), technicians, and nurses. The setting is safe and controlled so your risk is as low as possible.   You will be given medicine (a sedative) before the procedure to help you relax.  - The skin on your neck, arm, or groin will be cleaned well and made numb with an anesthetic.  - Next, the doctor will make a small cut in the skin.  - A small, flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted through this cut into one of the blood vessels in the area. The doctor will use live x-ray images to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart.    Once the catheter is in place, your doctor will place small electrodes in different areas of your heart.  - These electrodes are connected to monitors that allow the cardiologist to tell what area in your heart is causing problems with your heart rhythm. In most cases, there are one or more specific areas.  - Once the source of the problem has been found, one of the catheter lines is used to send electrical (or sometimes cold) energy to the problem area.  - This creates a small scar that causes the heart rhythm problem to stop.    Catheter ablation is a long procedure. It can last 4 or more hours. During the procedure your heart will be monitored closely. A health care provider may ask you if you are having symptoms at different times during the procedure. Symptoms you may feel are:  - A brief burning when medicines are injected  - A faster or stronger heartbeat  - Light-headedness  - Burning when the electrical energy is used

Why the Procedure is Performed : Cardiac ablation is used to treat certain heart rhythm problems that medicines are not controlling. These problems may be dangerous if they are not treated.  Common symptoms of heart rhythm problems may include:  - Chest pain  - Fainting  - Slow or fast heartbeat (palpitations)  - Light-headedness, dizziness  - Paleness  - Shortness of breath  - Skipping beats - changes in the pattern of the pulse  - Sweating    Some heart rhythm problems are:  - AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)  - Accessory pathway, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome  - Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter  - Ventricular tachycardia

Risks : Catheter ablation is generally safe. Talk with your provider about these rare complications:  - Bleeding or blood pooling where the catheter is inserted  - Blood clot that goes to arteries in your leg, heart, or brain  - Damage to the artery where the catheter is inserted  - Damage to heart valves  - Damage to the coronary arteries (blood vessels that carry blood to your heart)  - Esophageal atrial fistula (a connection that forms between your esophagus and part of your heart)  - Fluid around the heart (cardiac tamponade)  - Heart attack  - Vagal or phrenic nerve damage

Before the Procedure : Always tell your provider what drugs you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription.  During the days before the procedure:  - Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of the surgery.  - Tell your provider if you are taking aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), warfarin (Coumadin), or another blood thinner.  - If you smoke, stop before the procedure. Ask your provider for help if you need it.  - Tell your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness.    On the day of the procedure:  - You will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your procedure.  - Take the drugs your providerhas told you to take with a small sip of water.  - You will be told when to arrive at the hospital.

After the Procedure : Pressure to reduce bleeding is put on the area where the catheters were inserted into your body. You will be kept in bed for at least 1 hour. You may need to stay in bed for up to 5 or 6 hours. Your heart rhythm will be checked during this time.  Your doctor will decide whether you can go home on the same day, or if you will need to stay in the hospital overnight for continued heart monitoring. You will need someone to drive you home after your procedure.  For 2 or 3 days after your procedure, you may have these symptoms:  - Fatigue  - Achy feeling in your chest  - Skipped heartbeats, or times when your heartbeat is very fast or irregular.    Your doctor may keep you on your medicines, or give you new ones that help control your heart rhythm.

Answer: Due to the small number of HPS cases, the ""incubation time"" is not positively known. However, on the basis of limited information, it appears that symptoms may develop between 1 and 5 weeks after exposure to fresh urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents.
  Early Symptoms
  
    
   
Early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups—thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms are universal.
   
There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms.
  
  Late Symptoms
  
    
   
Four to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a ""...tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face"" as the lungs fill with fluid.

CDC_0000212_Sec4.txt,"Question: what is the history of hps for Hantavirus ?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
Answer: The ""First""Outbreak
  
In May 1993, an outbreak of an unexplained pulmonary illness occurred in the southwestern United States, in an area shared by Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah known as ""The Four Corners"". A young, physically fit Navajo man suffering from shortness of breath was rushed to a hospital in New Mexico and died very rapidly.
   
  
While reviewing the results of the case, medical personnel discovered that the young man's fiancée had died a few days before after showing similar symptoms, a piece of information that proved key to discovering the disease. As Dr. James Cheek of the Indian Health Service (IHS) noted, ""I think if it hadn't been for that initial pair of people that became sick within a week of each other, we never would have discovered the illness at all"".
  
An investigation combing the entire Four Corners region was launched by the New Mexico Office of Medical Investigations (OMI) to find any other people who had a similar case history. Within a few hours, Dr. Bruce Tempest of IHS, working with OMI, had located five young, healthy people who had all died after acute respiratory failure.
  
A series of laboratory tests had failed to identify any of the deaths as caused by a known disease, such as bubonic plague. At this point, the CDC Special Pathogens Branch was notified. CDC, the state health departments of New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, the Indian Health Service, the Navajo Nation, and the University of New Mexico all joined together to confront the outbreak.
   
  
During the next few weeks, as additional cases of the disease were reported in the Four Corners area, physicians and other scientific experts worked intensively to narrow down the list of possible causes. The particular mixture of symptoms and clinical findings pointed researchers away from possible causes, such as exposure to a herbicide or a new type of influenza, and toward some type of virus. Samples of tissue from patients who had gotten the disease were sent to CDC for exhaustive analysis. Virologists at CDC used several tests, including new methods to pinpoint virus genes at the molecular level, and were able to link the pulmonary syndrome with a virus, in particular a previously unknown type of hantavirus.
  Researchers Launch Investigations to Pin Down the Carrier of the New Virus
   
  
Researchers knew that all other known hantaviruses were transmitted to people by rodents, such as mice and rats. Therefore, an important part of their mission was to trap as many different species of rodents living in the Four Corners region as possible to find the particular type of rodent that carried the virus. From June through mid-August of 1993, all types of rodents were trapped inside and outside homes where people who had hantavirus pulmonary syndrome had lived, as well as in piñon groves and summer sheep camps where they had worked. Additional rodents were trapped for comparison in and around nearby households as well. Taking a calculated risk, researchers decided not to wear protective clothing or masks during the trapping process. ""We didn't want to go in wearing respirators, scaring...everybody"", John Sarisky, an Indian Health Service environmental disease specialist said. However, when the almost 1,700 rodents trapped were dissected to prepare samples for analysis at CDC, protective clothing and respirators were worn.
  
Among rodents trapped, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was found to be the main host to a previously unknown type of hantavirus. Since the deer mouse often lives near people in rural and semi-rural areas—in barns and outbuildings, woodpiles, and inside people's homes—researchers suspected that the deer mouse might be transmitting the virus to humans. About 30% of the deer mice tested showed evidence of infection with hantavirus. Tests also showed that several other types of rodents were infected, although in lesser numbers.
  
The next step was to pin down the connection between the infected deer mice and households where people who had gotten the disease lived. Therefore, investigators launched a case-control investigation. They compared ""case"" households, where people who had gotten the disease lived, with nearby ""control"" households. Control households were similar to those where the case-patients lived, except for one factor: no one in the control households had gotten the disease.
  
The results? First, investigators trapped more rodents in case households than in control households, so more rodents may have been living in close contact with people in case households. Second, people in case households were more likely than those in control households to do cleaning around the house or to plant in or hand-plow soil outdoors in fields or gardens. However, it was unclear if the risk for contracting HPS was due to performing these tasks, or with entering closed-up rooms or closets to get tools needed for these tasks.
  
In November 1993, the specific hantavirus that caused the Four Corners outbreak was isolated. The Special Pathogens Branch at CDC used tissue from a deer mouse that had been trapped near the New Mexico home of a person who had gotten the disease and grew the virus from it in the laboratory. Shortly afterwards and independently, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) also grew the virus, from a person in New Mexico who had gotten the disease as well as from a mouse trapped in California.
   
  
The new virus was called Muerto Canyon virus — later changed to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) — and the new disease caused by the virus was named hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS.
  
The isolation of the virus in a matter of months was remarkable. This success was based on close cooperation of all the agencies and individuals involved in investigating the outbreak, years of basic research on other hantaviruses that had been conducted at CDC and USAMRIID, and on the continuing development of modern molecular virologic tests. To put the rapid isolation of the Sin Nombre virus in perspective, it took several decades for the first hantavirus discovered, the Hantaan virus, to be isolated.
  
                
  HPS Not Really a New Disease
  
As part of the effort to locate the source of the virus, researchers located and examined stored samples of lung tissue from people who had died of unexplained lung disease. Some of these samples showed evidence of previous infection with Sin Nombre virus—indicating that the disease had existed before the ""first"" known outbreak—it simply had not been recognized!
  
Other early cases of HPS have been discovered by examining samples of tissue belonging to people who had died of unexplained adult respiratory distress syndrome. By this method, the earliest known case of HPS that has been confirmed has been the case of a 38-year-old Utah man in 1959.
  
Interestingly, while HPS was not known to the epidemiologic and medical communities, there is evidence that it was recognized elsewhere. The Navajo Indians, a number of whom contracted HPS during the 1993 outbreak, recognize a similar disease in their medical traditions, and actually associate its occurrence with mice. As strikingly, Navajo medical beliefs concur with public health recommendations for preventing the disease.
  
                
  Why Did the Outbreak Occur in the Four Corners Area?
  
But why this sudden cluster of cases? The key answer to this question is that, during this period, there were suddenly many more mice than usual. The Four Corners area had been in a drought for several years. Then, in early 1993, heavy snows and rainfall helped drought-stricken plants and animals to revive and grow in larger-than-usual numbers. The area's deer mice had plenty to eat, and as a result they reproduced so rapidly that there were ten times more mice in May 1993 than there had been in May of 1992. With so many mice, it was more likely that mice and humans would come into contact with one another, and thus more likely that the hantavirus carried by the mice would be transmitted to humans.
  
                
  Person-to-Person Spread of HPS Decided Unlikely
  
""Although person-to-person spread [of HPS] has not been documented with any of the other known hantaviruses, we were concerned [during this outbreak] because we were dealing with a new agent"", said Charles Vitek, a CDC medical investigator.
  
Researchers and clinicians investigating the ongoing outbreak were not the only groups concerned about the disease. Shortly after the first few HPS patients died and it became clear that a new disease was affecting people in the area, and that no one knew how it was transmitted, the news media began extensive reporting on the outbreak. Widespread concern among the public ensued.
  
Unfortunately, the first victims of the outbreak were Navajo. News reports focused on this fact, and the misperception grew that the unknown disease was somehow linked to Navajos. As a consequence, Navajos found themselves at the center of intense media attention and the objects of the some people's fears.
  
By later in the summer of 1993, the media frenzy had quieted somewhat, and the source of the disease was pinpointed. Researchers determined that, like other hantaviruses, the virus that causes HPS is not transmitted from person to person the way other infections, such as the common cold, may be. The exception to this is an outbreak of HPS in Argentina in 1996. Evidence from this outbreak suggests that strains of hantaviruses in South America may be transmissable from person to person.
  
To date, no cases of HPS have been reported in the United States in which the virus was transmitted from one person to another. In fact, in a study of health care workers who were exposed to either patients or specimens infected with related types of hantaviruses (which cause a different disease in humans), none of the workers showed evidence of infection or illness.
  
                
  HPS Since the First Outbreak
  
After the initial outbreak, the medical community nationwide was asked to report any cases of illness with symptoms similar to those of HPS that could not be explained by any other cause. As a result, additional cases have been reported.
  
Since 1993, researchers have discovered that there is not just one hantavirus that causes HPS, but several. In June 1993, a Louisiana bridge inspector who had not traveled to the Four Corners area developed HPS. An investigation was begun. The patient's tissues were tested for the presence of antibodies to hantavirus. The results led to the discovery of another hantavirus, named Bayou virus, which was linked to a carrier, the rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). In late 1993, a 33-year-old Florida man came down with HPS symptoms; he later recovered. This person also had not traveled to the Four Corners area. A similar investigation revealed yet another hantavirus, named the Black Creek Canal virus, and its carrier, the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus). Another case occurred in New York. This time, the Sin Nombre-like virus was named New York-1, and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), was implicated as the carrier.
  
More recently, cases of HPS stemming from related hantaviruses have been documented in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, making HPS a pan-hemispheric disease.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000256.htm
Answer: The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to diagnose appendicitis in young children, the elderly, and women of childbearing age.  The first symptom is often pain around the belly button. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low fever.  The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney's point. This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts.  If your appendix breaks open (ruptures), you may have less pain for a short time and you may feel better. However, the pain soon gets worse and you will feel sicker.  Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include:  - Chills and shaking  - Hard stools  - Diarrhea  - Fever  - Nausea and vomiting)", 4-Excellent, ADAM_0000301_Sec3.txt,What are the symptoms of Appendicitis ?,"The symptoms of appendicitis can vary.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm
Answer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007306.htm
Answer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.  The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.  Glucose level can drop if:  - There is too much insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinism). Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.  - The baby is not producing enough glucose.  - The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.  - The baby is not able to feed enough to keep glucose level up.   Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.  Low blood sugar level ismore likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:  - Born early, have a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery  - Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)  - Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy  - Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age)", 4-Excellent, ADAM_0002437_Sec2.txt,What causes Low blood sugar - newborns ?

Answer: Diverticula are small pouches that bulge outward through the colon, or large intestine. If you have these pouches, you have a condition called diverticulosis. It becomes more common as people age. About half of all people over age 60 have it. Doctors believe the main cause is a low-fiber diet.    Most people with diverticulosis don't have symptoms. Sometimes it causes mild cramps, bloating or constipation. Diverticulosis is often found through tests ordered for something else. For example, it is often found during a colonoscopy to screen for cancer. A high-fiber diet and mild pain reliever will often relieve symptoms.    If the pouches become inflamed or infected, you have a condition called diverticulitis. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, usually on the left side. You may also have fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, cramping, and constipation. In serious cases, diverticulitis can lead to bleeding, tears, or blockages.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets
Answer: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is a disorder related to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). Phosphate is a mineral that is essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth.  In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets begin in early childhood. The features of the disorder vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphatemia without other signs and symptoms. More severely affected children experience slow growth and are shorter than their peers. They develop bone abnormalities that can interfere with movement and cause bone pain. The most noticeable of these abnormalities are bowed legs or knock knees (a condition in which the lower legs are positioned at an outward angle). These abnormalities become apparent with weight-bearing activities such as walking. If untreated, they tend to worsen with time.  Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can include premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis) and dental abnormalities. The disorder may also cause abnormal bone growth where ligaments and tendons attach to joints (enthesopathy). In adults, hypophosphatemia is characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia.  Researchers have described several forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause. The most common form of the disorder is known as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). It has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder are much rarer. The different inheritance patterns are described below.  Another rare type of the disorder is known as hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH). In addition to hypophosphatemia, this condition is characterized by the excretion of high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria).)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets
Answer: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can result from mutations in several genes. Mutations in the PHEX gene, which are responsible for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, occur most frequently. Mutations in other genes cause the less common forms of the condition.  Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by a phosphate imbalance in the body. Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally excrete excess phosphate in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed. However, in people with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, the kidneys cannot reabsorb phosphate effectively and too much of this mineral is excreted from the body in urine. As a result, not enough phosphate is available in the bloodstream to participate in normal bone development and maintenance.  The genes associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are involved in maintaining the proper balance of phosphate. Many of these genes, including the PHEX gene, directly or indirectly regulate a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 (produced from the FGF23 gene). This protein normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the bloodstream. Gene mutations increase the production or reduce the breakdown of fibroblast growth factor 23. The resulting overactivity of this protein reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to hypophosphatemia and the related features of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets.)", 4-Excellent, GHR_0000464_Sec3.txt,What are the genetic changes related to hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets ?

GHR_0000464_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets inherited ? (Also called: hypophosphatemia; VDRR; vitamin D-resistant rickets)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets
Answer: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.  In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. However, some parents of children with HHRH have experienced hypercalcuria and kidney stones.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death. Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec3.txt,"Question: How to prevent Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: A Vaccine for Adults 60 and Older In May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine (Zostavax) to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. The vaccine is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. Even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. In a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 60 years old or older, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by about half. A One-time Dose To reduce the risk of shingles, adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. Even if the shingles vaccine doesnt prevent you from getting shingles, it can still reduce the chance of having long-term pain. If you have had shingles before, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine. Side Effects Vaccine side effects are usually mild and temporary. In most cases, shingles vaccine causes no serious side effects. Some people experience mild reactions that last up to a few days, such as headache or redness, soreness, swelling, or itching where the shot was given. When To Get the Vaccine The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your health care provider. The shingles vaccine is not recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. Although there is no specific time that you must wait after having shingles before receiving the shingles vaccine, you should generally make sure that the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. Where To Get the Vaccine The shingles vaccine is available in doctors offices, pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, and health departments. Most private health insurance plans cover recommended vaccines. Check with your insurance provider for details and for a list of vaccine providers. Medicare Part D plans cover shingles vaccine, but there may be costs to you depending on your specific plan. If you do not have health insurance, visit www.healthcare.gov  to learn more about health insurance options. Who Should Not Get the Vaccine? You should NOT get the shingles vaccine if you - have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone  - have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - have a weakened immune system because of:  -- HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system   -- treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids   -- cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy   -- cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.  have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine.

To learn more about the vaccine, see Zostavax: Questions and Answers.  Could Vaccines Make Shingles a Rare Disease? The shingles vaccine is basically a stronger version of the chickenpox vaccine, which became available in 1995. The chickenpox shot prevents chickenpox in 70 to 90 percent of those vaccinated, and 95 percent of the rest have only mild symptoms. Millions of children and adults have already received the chickenpox shot. Interestingly, the chickenpox vaccine may reduce the shingles problem. Widespread use of the chickenpox vaccine means that fewer people will get chickenpox in the future. And if people do not get chickenpox, they cannot get shingles.

Answer: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.  To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:  - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.  - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.     People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the bloodinto muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and because their liver makestoo much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:  - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin  - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally  - Both of the above    There are 2 major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:   - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.  - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.  - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.

URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/diabetes/toc.html
Answer: Too Much Glucose in the Blood Diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. Your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. But too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. Your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. Insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. If your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. It stays in your blood instead. Your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. Types of Diabetes There are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. The result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. Over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. However, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. With this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. About 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. To survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. Learn more about type 1 diabetes here. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. Although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. Over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. If your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. Learn more about type 2 diabetes here. Gestational Diabetes Some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life. Prediabetes Prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. The good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. With modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.  Learn more about prediabetes here.  Signs of Diabetes Many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. Some lose weight without trying. Additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. Some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all. How Many Have Diabetes? Nearly 29 million Americans age 20 or older (12.3 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes, according to 2014 estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. People can get diabetes at any age, but the risk increases as we get older. In 2014, over 11 million older adults living in the U.S -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes. See more statistics about diabetes from the  National Diabetes Statistics Report 2014. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) If Diabetes is Not Managed Diabetes is a very serious disease. Over time, diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, gums and teeth. If you have diabetes, you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke. People with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others.

Your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. But too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. Your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. Insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. If your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. It stays in your blood instead. Your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. Types of Diabetes There are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. The result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. Over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. However, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. With this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. About 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. To survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. Learn more about type 1 diabetes here. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. Although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin.

ADAM_0000640_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium in diet (Also called: Diet - calcium)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002412.htm
Answer: Summary : Calcium is the most plentiful mineral found in the human body. The teeth and bones contain the most calcium. Nerve cells, body tissues, blood, and other body fluids contain the rest of the calcium.

Function : Calcium is one of the most important minerals for the human body. It helps form and maintain healthy teeth and bones. A proper level of calcium in the body over a lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis.  Calcium helps your body with:  - Building strong bones and teeth  - Clotting blood  - Sending and receiving nerve signals  - Squeezing and relaxing muscles  - Releasing hormones and other chemicals  - Keeping a normal heartbeat

Food Sources : CALCIUM AND DAIRY PRODUCTS  Many foods contain calcium, but dairy products are the best source. Milk and dairy products such as yogurt, cheeses, and buttermilk contain a form of calcium that your body can easily absorb.  Whole milk (4% fat) is recommended for children ages 1 to 2. Adults and children over age 2 should drink low-fat (2% or 1%) milk or skim milk and other dairy products. Removing the fat will not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product.  - Yogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk are excellent sources of calcium and come in low-fat or fat-free versions.  - Milk is also a good source of phosphorus and magnesium, which help the body absorb and use calcium.  - Vitamin D is needed to helpyour body use calcium. Milk is fortified with vitamin D for this reason.    OTHER SOURCES OF CALCIUM  Other sources of calcium that can help meet your body's calcium needs include:  - Green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bok choy or Chinese cabbage  - Salmon and sardines canned with their soft bones  - Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and dried beans  - Blackstrap molasses    Calcium is often added to food products. These include foods such asorange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. These are a very good source of calcium for people who do not eat a lot of dairy products.  Ways to make sure you get enough calcium in your diet:  - Cook foods in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time to keep more calcium in the foods you eat. (This means steaming or sauting to cook instead ofboiling foods.)  - Be careful aboutthe other foods you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat bran, and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb) can bind with calcium and prevent it from being absorbed. This is why leafy greens are not considered an adequatesource of calcium by themselves, because your body is unable to utilize much of the calcium they contain. People on a vegan diet need to be sure to also include soy products and fortified products in order to get enough calcium.   DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS  Calcium is also found in many multivitamin-mineral supplements. The amount varies, depending on the supplement. Dietary supplements may contain only calcium, or calcium with other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the label on the Supplement Facts panel of the package to determine the amount of calcium in the supplement. Calcium absorption is best when taken in amounts of no more than 500 mg at a time.  Two commonly available forms of calcium dietary supplements include calcium citrate and calcium carbonate.  - Calcium citrate is the more expensive form of the supplement. It is taken up well by the body on a full or empty stomach.  - Calcium carbonate is less expensive. It is absorbed better by the body if taken with food. Calcium carbonate is found in over-the-counter antacid products such as Rolaids or Tums. Each chew or pill usually provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium. Check the label for the exact amount.    Other types of calcium in supplements and foods include calcium lactate, calcium gluconate, and calcium phosphate.

Side Effects : Increased calcium for a limited period of time does not normally cause side effects. However, receiving higher amounts of calcium over a long period of time raises the risk of kidney stones in some people.  Those who do not receive enough calcium over a long period of time can develop osteoporosis (thinning of bone tissue and loss of bone density over time). Other disorders are also possible.  People with lactose intolerance have trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in milk. Over-the-counter products are available that make it easier to digest lactose. You can also buy lactose-free milk at most grocery stores. Most people who do not suffer from severe lactose-intolerance are still able to digest hard cheeses and yogurt.  Tell your health care provider about any dietary supplements and medicines you take. Your provider can tell you if those dietary supplements might interact or interfere with your prescription or over-the-counter medicines. In addition, some medicines might interfere with how your body absorbs calcium.

Recommendations : The preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplement. How much calcium you need depends on your age and gender. Other factors, such as pregnancy and illnesses, are also important.  Recommendations for calcium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include:  - Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97 to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.  - Adequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.   The preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplementif they do not get enough calcium from the foods they eat.  Infants (AI)  - 0to 6 months: 200 milligrams per day (mg/day)  - 7to 12 months: 260 mg/day    Children and Adolescents (RDA)  - Age 1to 3: 700 mg/day  - Age 4to 8: 1,000 mg/day  - Age 9 to 18: 1,300 mg/day    Adults (RDA)  - Age 19to 50: 1,000 mg/day  - Age 50to 70: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day  - Over age 71:1,200 mg/day    Pregnancy and breast-feeding (RDA)  - Age 14to 18: 1,300 mg/day  - Age 19to 50: 1,000 mg/day    Up to 2,500to 3,000 mg a day of calcium from dietary sources and supplements appears to be safe for children and adolescents, and 2,000to 2,500 mg a day appears to be safe for adults.  The following list can help you determine how much calcium you are getting from food:  - 8-ounce glass of milk = 300 mg of calcium  - 1.5 ounces of Swiss cheese = 300 mg of calcium  - 6 ounces of yogurt = 300 mg of calcium  - 3 ounces of sardines with bones = 200 mg of calcium  -  cup of cooked turnip greens = 100 mg of calcium  -  cup of almonds = 100 mg of calcium  - 1 medium orange = 50 mg calcium  - 1 medium baked sweet potato = 50 mg calcium   Vitamin D is needed to help the body absorb calcium.

Answer: Summary : WHO SHOULD TAKE CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS?  Calcium is an important mineral for the human body. It helps build and protect your teeth and bones. Getting enough calcium over your lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis.  Most people get enough calcium in their normal diet. Dairy foods and leafy green vegetables have high levels of calcium. Older women and men may need extra calcium to prevent their bones from getting thin (osteoporosis).  Your health care provider will tell you if you need to take extra calcium.  TYPES OF CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS   Forms of calcium include:  - Calcium carbonate: Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products, such as Tums and Rolaids, contain calcium carbonate. These sources of calcium do not cost much. Each pill or chew provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium.  - Calcium citrate: This is a more expensive form of calcium. It is absorbed well on an empty or full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid (a condition that is more common in people over age 50) absorb calcium citrate better than calcium carbonate.  - Other forms, such as calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, calcium phosphate: Most have less calcium than the carbonate and citrate forms.    When choosing a calcium supplement:  - Look the word ""purified"" or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label.  - Avoid products made from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite that do not have the USP symbol. They may have high levels of lead or other toxic metals.    HOW TO TAKE EXTRA CALCIUM   Increase the dose of your calcium supplement slowly. Start with 500 mg a day for a week, and then add more over time.  Try to spread the extra calcium you take over the day. DO NOT take more than 500 mg at a time. Taking calcium throughout the day will:  - Allow more calcium to be absorbed  - Cut down on side effects such as gas, bloating, and constipation    The total amount of calcium adults need every day from food and calcium supplements:  - 19 to 50 years: 1,000 mg/day  - 51 to 70 years: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day  - 71 years and over: 1,200 mg/day    The body needs vitamin D to help absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight exposure to your skin and from your diet. Ask your provider whether you need to take a vitamin D supplement.

ADAM_0002800_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Nicotine and tobacco (Also called: Withdrawal from nicotine; Smoking - nicotine addiction and withdrawal; Smokeless tobacco - nicotine addiction; Cigar smoking; Pipe smoking; Smokeless snuff; Tobacco use; Chewing tobacco; Nicotine addiction and tobacco)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000953.htm
Answer: Summary : The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine.

Causes : Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed.   - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance.  - Millions of people in the U.S. have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the U.S. has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong.    Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks.

Symptoms : Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can:  - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking  - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression  - Increase activity in the intestines  - Create more saliva and phlegm  - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute  - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mmHg  - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea  - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well    Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include:  - Intense craving for nicotine  - Anxiety  - Depression  - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping  - Bad dreams and nightmares  - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated  - Headaches  - Increased appetite and weight gain  - Problems concentrating    You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke.

Treatment : It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking.  There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone.  To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences.  Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking.  A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.  Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of:   - Gum  - Inhalers  - Throat lozenges  - Nasal spray  - Skin patches    You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms.  Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong.  Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again.

Support Groups : Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.

Outlook (Prognosis) : People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again.

Possible Complications : There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments.)", 4-Excellent, ADAM_0002800_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Nicotine and tobacco (Also called: Withdrawal from nicotine; Smoking - nicotine addiction and withdrawal; Smokeless tobacco - nicotine addiction; Cigar smoking; Pipe smoking; Smokeless snuff; Tobacco use; Chewing tobacco; Nicotine addiction and tobacco),"Summary : The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine."

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003816.htm
Answer: Summary : An upper GI and small bowel series is a set of x-rays taken to examine the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.  Barium enema is a related test.

How the Test is Performed : An upper GI and small bowel series is done in a health care office or hospital radiology department.  You may get an injection of a medicine that slows muscle movement in the small intestine. This makes it easier to see the structures of your organs on the x-rays.  Before the x-rays are taken, you must drink 16 to 20 ounces of a milkshake-like drink. The drink contains a substance called barium, which shows up well on x-rays.  An x-ray method called fluoroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Pictures are taken while you sit or stand in different positions.   The test most often takes around 3 hours but can take as long as 6 hours to complete.  A GI series may include this test or a barium enema.

How to Prepare for the Test : You may have to change your diet for 2 or 3 days before the test. In most cases, you will not be able to eat for a period of time before the test.  Be sure to ask your health care provider if you need to change how you take any of your medicines. Often you can continue taking the medicines you take by mouth. Never make any changes in your medicines without first talking to your provider.  You will be asked to remove all jewelry on your neck, chest, or abdomen before the test.

How the Test will Feel : The x-ray may cause mild bloating but no discomfort most of the time. The barium milkshake feels chalky as you drink it.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to look for a problem in the structure or function of your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine.

Normal Results : A normal result shows that the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are normal in size, shape, and movement.  Normal value ranges may vary depending on the lab doing the test. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results in the esophagus may indicate the following problems:   - Achalasia  - Diverticula  - Esophageal cancer  - Esophageal narrowing (stricture) - benign  - Hiatal hernia  - Ulcers   Abnormal results in the stomach may indicate the following problems:   - Gastric cancer  - Gastric ulcer - benign  - Gastritis  - Polyps (a tumor that is usually noncancerous and grows on the mucus membrane)  - Pyloric stenosis (narrowing)    Abnormal results in the stomach may indicate the following problems:   - Malabsorption syndrome  - Swelling and irritation of the small intestines  - Tumors  - Ulcers    The test may also be done for the following conditons:  - Annular pancreas  - Duodenal ulcer  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease  - Gastroparesis  - Intestinal obstruction  - Lower esophageal ring  - Primary or idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction

Risks : You are exposed to a low level of radiation during this test, which carries a very small risk of cancer. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.  Pregnant women should not have this test in most cases. Children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays.  Barium may cause constipation. Talk to your provider if the barium has not passed through your system by 2 or 3 days after the exam.

Considerations : The upper GI series should be done after other x-ray procedures, because the barium that remains in the body may block details in other imaging tests.)", 4-Excellent, ADAM_0004097_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Upper GI and small bowel series (Also called: GI series; Barium swallow x-ray; Upper GI series),"Summary : An upper GI and small bowel series is a set of x-rays taken to examine the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.

NHLBI_0000058_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Heart Attack ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack
Answer: Espaol
                
A heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart cant get oxygen. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die.
                
Heart attack treatment works best when its given right after symptoms occur. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if youre not sure, call 911 right away.
                
Overview
                
Heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.
                
When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.
                
Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.
                
If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.
                
Heart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery
                

                
A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.
                
Heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias.
                
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away.
                
Don't Wait--Get Help Quickly
                
Acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. Treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur.
                

                
Many people aren't sure what's wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:
                
Chest pain or discomfort.Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.
                
Upper body discomfort.You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).
                
Shortness of breath.This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.
                
Other possible symptoms of a heart attack include:
                
Breaking out in a cold sweat
                
Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)
                
Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting
                
Light-headedness or sudden dizziness
                
Any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)
                
Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.
                
Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 911
                
If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 911 for emergency medical care. Acting fast can save your life.
                
Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Take a nitroglycerin pill if your doctor has prescribed this type of treatment.)", 4-Excellent, NHLBI_0000058_Sec1.txt,What is (are) Heart Attack ?,Espaol

NIHSeniorHealth_0000033_Sec3.txt,"Question: What causes Heart Attack ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/heartattack/toc.html
Answer: Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. When blood cannot reach part of your heart, that area starves for oxygen. If the blockage continues long enough, cells in the affected area die. The Most Common Cause Coronary heart disease (CHD)is the most common underlying cause of a heart attack. CHD, also called coronary artery disease, is the hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by the buildup of plaque inside the walls of the arteries. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). The buildup of plaque occurs over many years. Over time, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Other Causes Heart attack also can occur due to problems with the very small, microscopic blood vessels of the heart. This condition is called microvascular disease. It's believed to be more common in women than in men. A less common cause of heart attacks is a severe spasm or tightening of the coronary artery that cuts off blood flow to the heart. These spasms can occur in persons with or without coronary artery disease. What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn't always clear. A spasm may be related to emotional stress or pain, exposure to extreme cold, cigarette smoking, or by taking certain drugs like cocaine. Risk Factors You Cannot Change Certain factors make it more likely that you will develop coronary artery disease and have a heart attack. These risk factors include some things you cannot change. If you are a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55, you are at greater risk. Having a family history of early heart disease, diagnosed in a father or brother before age 55 or in a mother or sister before age 65, is another risk factor. You are also at risk if you have a personal history of angina or previous heart attack, or if you have had a heart procedure such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Risk Factors You Can Change Importantly, there are many risk factors that you can change. These include - smoking  - being overweight or obese  - physical inactivity  - high blood pressure  - high blood cholesterol  - high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes   - an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). smoking being overweight or obese physical inactivity high blood pressure high blood cholesterol high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). Metabolic Syndrome Some of these risk factorssuch as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugartend to occur together. When they do, it's called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person with metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone without metabolic syndrome.)", 4-Excellent, NIHSeniorHealth_0000033_Sec3.txt,What causes Heart Attack ?,"Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle.

Answer: The doctor will do a physical exam to:   - Check for problems with vision, movement, feeling, reflexes, understanding, and speaking. Your doctor and nurses will repeat this exam over time to see if your stroke is getting worse or improving.  - Listen to the carotid arteries in the neck with a stethoscope for an abnormal sound, called a bruit, which is caused by abnormal blood flow.  - Check for high blood pressure.     You may have the following tests to help find the type, location, and cause of the stroke and rule out other problems:   - Angiogram of the head to look for a blood vessel that is blocked or bleeding  - Carotid duplex (ultrasound) to see if the carotid arteries in your neck have narrowed  - Echocardiogram to see if the stroke could have been caused by a blood clot from the heart  - Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography to check for abnormal blood vessels in the brain    Other tests include:   - Blood tests  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rhythm monitoring)", 4-Excellent, ADAM_0003751_Sec4.txt,How to diagnose Stroke ?
